        <p>My name is Elisha Santiago Felipe. I am a man who was born on the 2nd of January 1998 in Las Pi√±as, the youngest of five children. Jose is my father's name, and Maribel is my mother's name.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a short story. From 2014 to 2018, I studied computer engineering at TUP, and currently I am studying Information Technology. From 2020 to the present, I've been doing it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Playing video games, traveling, and reading novels are some of my favorite pastimes. I enjoy playing games because it helps me to maintain my mental wellness. Apart from that, I adore traveling because it allows me to meet new people and experience new places. I'll also get a copy of the remarkable story. Last but not least, reading a novel. I enjoy reading books that make me feel as if I am a part of the tale. The nice novel, in my opinion, reflects the writer's feelings nicely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am the one who has a big ambition. Always striving to achieve greatness. My idleness, on the other hand, is always attempting to crush my spirit. One of my flaws is that I am not a confident person. When I have to speak in front of a group, I get nervous. As a result, I chose to express my desire through words.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aside from weakness, I definitely have an excess. I'm an optimist by nature. My parents constantly told me as a child that I was a successful boy who would grow up to be a successful man. I am certain that I am a creative, pleasant, and intelligent individual in various aspects. I always do what I want and attempt to come up with something unique that the others don't mind. I always aim to provide my best, both for myself and for others. I'm hoping that all I want will come true.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My mother is a source of inspiration for me. She constantly gives me a direction to face anything and gives me the courage to look ahead, and she is always optimistic in her pursuit of my goals. She constantly tells me that I am the best and that she is my angel. My spirit is my family. The most memorable moment in my life occurred when I was born into this world and became one of my mother's children.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Okay, I think I've said enough about myself. If we meet again at a later time, I'll see you then.</p>
